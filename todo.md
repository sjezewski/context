Cases to handle

- switching gcloud accounts (this involves resetting the default application credentials ... which seem to be a global)
- switching between local docker / docker-machine
- switching between k8s contexts (minikube, local k8s, docker-machine k8s)

- setting pachctl ADDRESS
- vs using k8s port forward
- vs using docker machine port forwarding
